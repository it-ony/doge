# Doge

THE PLUGIN IS WORK IN PROGRESS! See [why](#why)

This is a add-in for Autodesk Fusion 360 can create a dogbones. The structure of the code has been taken from
Florian Pommerening [Fingerjoin Plugin](https://github.com/FlorianPommerening/FingerJoints). The algorithm has 
been adapted from the [Dogebone Plugin](https://github.com/DVE2000/Dogbone) of Peter Ludikar, which has 
[more contributors](https://github.com/DVE2000/Dogbone#authors).

## Why?

Fusion 360 has an experimental custom feature API, which basically doesn't work and is not moving in any direction, 
that custom features will be a thing. At the same time, I'm bored of re-creating features, every time I update the model.

I'm exploring way of refreshing features without the need to re-create them and without custom features from Autodesk.
